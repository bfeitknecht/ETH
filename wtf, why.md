even though i feel like i'm picking at a mountain with a toothpick, i'll keep at it. once begun, is halfway done. it's difficult for me to give you understanding of the situation. i can give you elaborations, i can give you reasoning, but in the end it's not solely up to me to accept myself. we need to do this together.

if only i could understand myself. i want to give myself fully to you. 

it is now my responsibility to compile what's happened and why to give you a chance at closure.
i take this very seriously. i will thoroughly search my chat histories with different people, consult the voice recordings of my talks with some of my friends regarding the time period of us starting to get closer.

i think a lot of our mutual frustration stems from a lack of complete and precise documentation. to be able to deliver just that is my goal.











for all i know, i don't know



problem
fears
wishes
possible proceedings
